# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple game of Tic Tac Toe that can be played using a web browser.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To run the game, simply open https://aishee-das.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
To play the game, simply click on an empty square to place your mark (X or O). The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. You can reset the game by clicking the "Reset" button.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
This game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
In the future, I plan to add sound effects and an AI opponent using a minimax algorithm to make the game more challenging.
